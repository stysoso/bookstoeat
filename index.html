            <h2>Some thoughts on the disposal of <em>old</em> books...</h2>
                <p>In a time of book digitization, instead of composting, recycling, or donating physical books, 
                    here is a recipe to consume them instead, and become one with those books that you love. Why 
                    would you find yourself trying to rid of your books? Because they exist on your 
                    screen so they gotta go. Also it is good to be sustainable. Don't eat books that don't exist 
                    on your screens. Like food, I recommend you avoid eating highly processed books.</p>
                    <p>If books don't sound tasty, look at this recipe. If they still don't, you can always search 
                       for other ways to rid of them, either by donating them to be someone else's problem (or meal), 
                       composting, finding a paper recycling facility, putting them in one of those neighborhood book 
                       swap boxes, or inserting them into a library shelf unasked.</p>

            <h2>Book Soup</h2>
            <div>
                <p>If you find yourself with older books made with natural paper, you can cut out or rip
                    out the paper. The lovely thing on natural papers is that they love and readily absorb
                    water, as they are not too processed from what they originally were: a plant or tree. 
                    We hope that the boiling of the soup eliminates any toxic additives to the paper, as well
                    as anything that may leech from the ink of the text and images. I don't think you will
                    be eating Book Soup often, surely once-in-a-while exposure won't hurt.<br><br>
                    <b>Ingredients:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Broth (beef, chicken, or vegetable)</li>
                        <li>Onions</li>
                        <li>Seasonal vegetables</li>
                        <li>Salt</li>
                        <li>Bay leaves</li>
                        <li>Fennel (don't omit this!)</li>
                        <li>Seasonings of your taste</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The key is to boil the broth with the paper for a while before adding anything else.
                        This ensures that the fibers of the paper soften and separate with the swish of a ladel.
                        If there is text or thick stroked fonts printed on the paper, you may have to fish
                        it out with the butt end of the ladel. The flavor of book itself is not remarkable,
                        the texture that it imbues is where it is at. Make sure you add plenty of vegetables
                        and seasoning and fennel to mask the taste of old book. Fennel has a unique property
                        where it masks the more unsavory notes of old wet paper. You can't overcook the paper
                        fibers, so add the vegetables and cook them well too. Remove bay leaves before serving.
                    </p>
                    <p>Lastly, if you are more for the creamier soups than what the books add to the texture, 
                        I recommend adding lentils or potatoes with some heavy cream.</p>
